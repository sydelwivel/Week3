# 🌍 Global Power Plant Data Analysis & Visualization ⚡📊

Welcome to my data analysis project where I explore how the world generates electricity!  
Using real-world data 🌐, I cleaned, analyzed, and visualized global power plant trends across countries and fuel types.

## 🔧 What This Project Does

✨ This project helps to:

- Understand which countries produce the most electricity  
- Explore the most used fuels (like Coal, Hydro, Solar, etc.)  
- Visualize the number and capacity of power plants worldwide  

---

## 🗂 Steps I Followed

🔹 Loaded the dataset using **Pandas**  
🔹 Cleaned the data (removed unnecessary columns, filled missing values)  
🔹 Grouped and analyzed data by fuel types and countries  
🔹 Created clean and colorful charts using **Matplotlib**

## 📊 Visualizations You’ll See

- ✅ **Stacked Bar Chart**: Top 4 fuel types across countries  
- ✅ **Horizontal Bar Graph**: Countries with the most power plants  
- ✅ **Bar Chart**: Top 10 countries by electricity capacity (MW)  
- ✅ **Pie Chart**: Most used fuel types around the world 🌍
